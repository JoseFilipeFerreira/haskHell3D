# haskHell3D

Implementation of a 3D shooter that uses the same mechanics
as Doom to simulate 3D programmed in Haskell and Gloss

## Getting Started
### Setting up

* Make sure you have [Gloss](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/gloss) and [Data.Geometry.Polygon](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/hgeometry-0.7.0.0/docs/Data-Geometry-Polygon.html) installed

```
cd src && sh build.sh
```

## Dependency

* [Haskell-Gloss](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/gloss)
* [Data.Geometry.Polygon](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/hgeometry-0.7.0.0/docs/Data-Geometry-Polygon.html)
